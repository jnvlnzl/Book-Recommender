# Book-Recommender

This book recommender system was developed using collaborative filtering with the R package _'recommenderlab'_. The dataset was extracted from Kaggle user Fahad Mehfooz in their work titled [Book Recommendation System](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fahadmehfoooz/book-recommendation-system/notebook). It contains three CSV files, _books.csv, ratings.csv,_ and _users.csv_. The datasets were preprocessed and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted on each before merging the files.
